# README


The goal of this repo is to export the [OpenAI CLIP RN50](https://github.com/openai/CLIP) model from  pytorch to onnx-js compatible one.
Exporting to onnx is not complicated, but since onnx-js has a lot of missing features, we need to rewrite some part of the model from scratch (ex. flatten, averagepooling).


> This repo is still in construction, a little tuto will be made soon to explain how I did it, which part are important and how to run it in your own browserâ€¦ (now the computed are just logged in the js console of the browserâ€¦)

> Stay tuned !

Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
